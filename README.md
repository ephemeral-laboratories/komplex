Komplex
=======

A simple complex math library for Kotlin.

Defines a `Complex` class with the usual operators you
would expect to be able to use with numbers.

Also defines a collection of functions, aiming for parity 
with the functions supported by `kotlin.math` for doubles,
but for complex numbers.
